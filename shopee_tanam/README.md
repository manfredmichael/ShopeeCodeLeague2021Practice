# Shopee Tanam

**Problem Statement**

In Shopee, there is a game called Shopee Tanam. Itâ€™s a game developed by Shopee
game developers in Indonesia. Shopee Tanam means that you can plant some plants
on the game platform. One of the game developers has an idea to create a new sub
game in Shopee Tanam. In the sub game, you are given a park and the park has 1
dimensional shape and it consists of **M** different cells.In each cell you must plant
exactly 1 tree. Each day, the tree can yield a beneficial fruit / poisonous fruit / neither
beneficial nor poisonous fruit. The beneficial fruit means that you will get a positive
number of health.The poisonous fruit gives you a negative number of health. Otherwise,
you will get 0 health.

Then you are given a character that will start at the left side of the one dimensional
park. You are given **N** days to play the game. Eachday, the number of health in each
fruit produced by a tree might change. In one day the character can do one of these
actions:

1. Not crossing the park at all (stay at the current spot).
2. Walk through the park going through up to **M** cells,gathering all the beneficial
    and poisonous fruits along the way, then the character turns around and goes
    back to the initial position before he walks through the park.
3. Crossing the park completely, and going to the opposite side of the park, then the
    character rests there.
Note: On one day, the fruit in a cell can be gotten **at most once.**

Help the character to get the maximum amount of health.

**Input**

There will be **T (1 <= T <= 10)** number of test cases.On each test case, there will be a
line with 2 integers, **N** and **M** (1 <= **N** <= 1000, 1 <= **M** <= 1000). Then **N** lines follow up,
with each line containing **M** integers, **Ai,j** (-10^9 <= **Ai,j** <= 10^9 ), which means the health of
the fruit on day **i** at cell **j**.

**Output**

The output must consist of **T** number of integers, indicatingthe maximum amount of
health that the character can get.

## Sample Output

103
```

**Explanation**

1. For the first example, the character can decide to not cross the park at all, hence
    the total health that the character gets is 0.
2. For the second example,
    a. On the first day, the character goes from the left, then completely crossing
       the park, then he rests at the right side of the park, and the total number of
       health is: 1 + 4 + (-5) = 0.
    b. On the second day, the character goes from the right side of the bridge,
       only to the first cell from the right, then goes back to the right side of the
       bridge, and the total number of health the character gets from the second
       day is 100.
    c. Hence, the total health that the character gets from 2 days is 0 + 100 =
       100.
3. For the third example,
    a. On the first day, the character goes from the left, but only getting the
       health from the first 2 cells, then the character goes back to the left side of
       the park, and the total number of health is: 1 + 4 = 5.
    b. On the second day, the character goes from the left side of the park, and
       goes completely crossing the park, gaining total health of: (-1) + (-1) + 100
       = 98 for the second day.
    c. Hence, the total health that the character gets from 2 days is 5 + 98 = 103.
